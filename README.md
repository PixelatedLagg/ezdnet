# ezdnet
### Important Note: This respository has been archived due to me switching to D#+, a Discord API wrapper that I recommend way more than Discord.NET.
## A library to simplify Discord.NET - Inspired by [ezdjs](https://github.com/MrEggoXYZ/ezdjs)
## To Start a Bot:
```
Ezclient.StartBot("bot_token", "command_prefix", if_debug);
```
### Returns:
```
Tuple<DiscordSocketClient client, CommandService command, IServiceProvider service>
```
